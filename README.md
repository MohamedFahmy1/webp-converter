## üìë Additional Notes

- **WebP Format**: WebP is an image format developed by Google that provides lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. It allows for superior image quality with smaller file sizes compared to formats like PNG and JPG, making it ideal for faster loading times on websites.
- **Browser Compatibility**: WebP is supported in most modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera. However, older browsers like Internet Explorer and some versions of Safari may not support it, so it‚Äôs important to have fallback formats like PNG or JPG.

Feel free to modify and contribute to this project to make it even better!
